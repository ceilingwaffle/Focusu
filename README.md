# Focusu!

A tool for osu! streamers to reduce distractions while you play, letting you focus solely on the game, instead of that sudden elevator of PogChamps and BTTV gifs flooding the corner of your eye.

# Features
- Blank the contents of your secondary monitors when you play a map.
- Automatic controls can un-blank your monitors when you:
    * Start a new map
    * Enter a map break
    * Pause the map

# Installing
1. Download the zip file of the [latest release](https://github.com/ceilingwaffle/Focusu/releases/tag/0.1.1).
2. Extract the zip file contents to a new folder.
3. Run **Focusu.GUI.exe**
4. If you encounter a "Windows protected your PC" message:
    - Click "More info" then "Run Anyway" to continue running Focusu. This message appears by default when you try to run any executable files downloaded from the internet on Windows 10.
